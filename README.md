# TitanicML

During my Summer '23 research at LehighU, my first project was to create a machine learning model.  I found a sample dataset on Kaggle that contained information about the passengers of the Titanic and whether or not they survived.  The goal is to develop a model with PyTorch that can predict whether or not a passenger survived based on data like their age, gender, and ticket cost.
